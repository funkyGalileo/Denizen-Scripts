Personal Notes:
  do not write npc assign --set [filename].dsc, use the functions in the file!
  Instead of using chat triggers (which aren't reliable for some reaosn), switching to a system where the player will be given 2 sticks with 2 different IDs and data
    I will then check if they right click the air with either one (one labelled stick for Yes, one for No)
  
Commands to Keep In Mind:
  walk, follow, teleport, equip (for after player defeats dungeon to give first armour directly), health, spawn, inventory, lookclose, pause/resume (navigation), actionbar,
  advancement, title, modifyblock
  
» Use to open a chest inventory, at a location. (loot after success, chests can be in a seperate bunker somewhere)
- inventory open d:<context.location>

» Use to change the range and make the NPC more realistic
- lookclose true range:10 realistic

Instead of typing in raw coordinates, use tags:

Noting Locations:
/ex note <player.location.below> as:exampleNote
  - not sure if I can use a command to keep track of all locations noted, so I will keep track here
      - glowShroom1 to glowShroom8
      - one sprce log location
      - groundGoddess1 to 4
      - first portal is 1 to 20
