Personal Notes:
  do not write npc assign --set [filename].dsc, use the functions in the file!
  
Commands to Keep In Mind:
  walk, follow, teleport, equip (for after player defeats dungeon to give first armour directly), health, spawn, inventory, lookclose, pause/resume (navigation), actionbar,
  advancement, title, modifyblock
  
» Use to open a chest inventory, at a location. (loot after success, chests can be in a seperate bunker somewhere)
- inventory open d:<context.location>

» Use to change the range and make the NPC more realistic
- lookclose true range:10 realistic
